# toasternotes

I have big ideas for this project and hopefully at some point I can make them a reality. For now this serves a temporary idea space.

I'd like to have a cute little toaster in the center of the page. You pop down the lever and in the bread goes. After a designated period of time, the toast pops out and on the toast is a message that you can view.

I'd like for the message to be added by someone else (a significant other, friend, family, etc.) and for the recipent to be notified through a cute text message, "you've got toast!" They can log in and view it.
